3. Activity 2: Let's run our first p5.js sketch
Objective: be able to create and run code using the p5.js web editor
p5.js is:
3.1. p5js.org
3.2. editor.p5js.org
3.3. line()
3.4. mouseX/mouseY
3.5. draw a line and move it using mouseX/mouseY


7. Activity: Let's add some randomness to the sketch
What are things that we could have change each time the sketch is run?
What were some of the decisions we had to make when we drew the sketch by hand?
    • placement
    • size
    • colour
8. Activity: Let's randomize placement
9. Activity: Let's randomize size
10. Activity: Let's randomize colour
11. Activity: Let's animate the transition between sketches
        ◦ easing
11.1.
12. Activity: Let's draw some complex shapes
    1. Using beginShape and endShape
    2. Using vertex
    3. Using curveVertex
Activity: replace some of the basic shapes in a virtual drawing into complex shapes
13. Activity: Let's parameterize our shapes
    1. Looping with the draw function
    2. Creating our own functions
    3. Parameterizing our functions
Activity: turn some of the complex shapes into functions and parameterize them so they change with each loop through the draw function
14. What else can we do with p5.js?
    1. Incorporating sketches into a web page
    2. Working with the DOM of a web page
    3. Playing sounds
    4. Playing video
    5. Accessing the webcam
