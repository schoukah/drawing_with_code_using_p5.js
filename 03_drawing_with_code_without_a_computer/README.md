Open your envelopes and:

    1. Using the pencil, draw a triangle anywhere on the page
    2. Somewhere in the remaining space, draw a circle
    3. Finally, in the remaining space, draw a square
    4. Colour in one of the shapes using the red crayon
    5. Colour in one of the remaining shapes using the yellow crayon
    6. Colour in the last shape using the blue crayon
