In the immortal words of Ms Frizzle: "Let's make some generative art!"

We're going to start by drawing with code without a computer. Open your envelopes and:

    1. Take out a piece of paper and the pencil
    2. Anywhere on the page, draw a triangle
    3. Somewhere in the remaining space, draw a circle
    4. Finally, in the remaining space, draw a square
    5. Colour in one of the shapes using the red crayon
    6. Colour in one of the remaining shapes using the yellow crayon
    7. Colour in the last shape using the blue crayon
    8. Repeat the instructions one more time using a new piece of paper
