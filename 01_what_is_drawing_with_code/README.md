# What is Drawing with Code?

- Drawing with Code is one type of Generative Art
- Which sorta begs the question...

## What is Generative Art?

Some search results I liked from duckduckgo.com:

> I often joke with my students that it is easy to tell if something is generative art.  First it must be art, and second it must be generative.  The joke here is, of course, I am begging the question.  One difficult question is replaced by two difficult questions. What do we mean by art, and what do we mean by generative?

> Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist.

> Generative art incorporates a self-governed or autonomous system in some way. Randomness is one type of autonomous system. By incorporating chance into a piece of code art, you get a different, completely unique piece of art each time you run your script, load your page, or respond to some user interaction....The artwork becomes a collaboration between the computer and the artist. Some aspects of the artwork are controlled by the coder, but not all of them.

> Generative art refers to works of art whose production involves some degree of randomness. Today, it is typically created using algorithmic computer programs, although any mechanical process with a certain level of autonomy can be used to produce generative art. An artist’s creative input in this type of art lies in establishing the framework that the randomized process can operate in; elements of both order and disorder are present. If a computer program is used, an essentially endless number of designs can be produced.

> ‘Generative art’ is a term for graphic designs that are created with the use of an autonomous system...Generative design is used in various areas of design, such as art, architecture, communications, industrial design, animation, and music. The phrase generative music was coined in 1995 by musician and composer Brian Eno.

> In 1995 whilst working with SSEYO KOAN PRO (later evolved to NOATIKL, then WOTJA), Brian Eno coined the term "Generative Music" to describe any music that is ever-different & changing, created by a system.

> With regard to the "what is generative art?" question one is often reminded of the parable of the blind men and the elephant.  One blind man feeling the leg of the elephant says, "Surely an elephant is like a mighty tree".  Another blind man, holding the trunk of the elephant says, "Surely an elephant is like a large snake".  Yet another blind man, placing his hands on the sides of the elephant, exclaims, "Surely an elephant is like a great whale".  And so on.  In a similar way artists seems to all too often define generative art as being most like the work that is closest at hand, namely their own generative art.
