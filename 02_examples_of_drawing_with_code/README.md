# What are some Examples of Drawing with Code?

Artists have been drawing with code both with and without computers.

## Sol LeWitt

> One of the most influential and interesting artists of the 20th century, and one who has particular relevance to those interested in Generative Design is Sol Lewitt. At his core he was a minimalist, so much so that most of his famous pieces were not even executed by him in person. He did not sell paintings on canvases, instead he sold “codes” or procedures with specific instructions that would then be implemented by a draftsman, who was required to faithfully execute the instructions, but whose own hand and judgement led to the final formal outcome of the work.

Here Are the Instructions for Sol LeWitt’s 1971 Wall Drawing for the School of the MFA Boston:

> “On a wall surface, any<br>
continuous stretch of wall,<br>
using a hard pencil, place<br>
fifty points at random.<br>
The points should be evenly<br>
distributed over the area<br>
of the wall. All of the<br>
points should be connected<br>
by straight lines. “

Here is an interpretation of his instructions that I coded using p5.js:

## Vera Molnar

> Starting in 1959, Molnár created paintings using what she called the “Imaginary Machine.” Molnár would follow a series of set instructions with slight variations to create paintings that explored “the subtleties that turn a collection of forms into the ‘epiphany’ of art.” In 1968, she began working with a computer and plotter to expand her examination of algorithmic art.
