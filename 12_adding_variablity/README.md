# Adding variability to our sketches

What are things that we could have change each time the sketch is run? What were some of the ways our drawings were different?

- placement
- size
- colour

## Using variables

We can make our sketches different each time they are run by using variables.

A variable is a name that represents a value.

    var x = 200;
    var y = 200;

We can use them in our sketches in place of using the numbers. Instead of coding

    point(200,200);

We can code:

    point(x,y);
