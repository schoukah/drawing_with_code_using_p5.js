# Welcome to Drawing with Code using p5.js

## Introductions

I'll go first and then we can go around the room.

Me:

- My name is Adam and I'm an artist
- I'm also an arts manager and technology consultant
- In a previous life I worked for software development companies
- Over the years I learned how to do a bit of computer programming (but I am not a professional programmer!)
- After too many years working for software companies I went back to school to study art and arts management
- While I was there I mostly made performance art and tried do as little as possible that involved computers
- After I graduated I kept on trying to make performance art and became a member of a collective that produced a biannual performance art festival
- In the last couple of years, I've returned to earlier interests in drawing
and multiples but instead of using pencil, paper, pen, and ink, I've been using a computer
- The computer language I'm using for my work is called p5.js, and that's why we're here today  

You:
- What kind of art are you making?
- What would you like to learn in this workshop?
- Have you had any experience writing computer programs?

## What we are going to do today?

We're going to:

- look at some examples of generative art and drawing with code
- use the p5.js web editor to write the code that will create our p5.js sketches
- use p5's built-in shapes to draw a sketch
- create variations of the sketch
- animate the transitions between the variations
- share our sketches over the web

## What we are not going to do today?

We aren't going to:

- explore the intricacies of programming in p5.js or JavaScript
<br>
(but we are going to learn some basic programming concepts as we need them)
- we aren't going to do a lot of math
<br>
(but we are going to do a little bit)
