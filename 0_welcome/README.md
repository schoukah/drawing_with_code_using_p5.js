# Welcome to Drawing with Code using p5.js

# Introductions

I'll go first and then we can go around the room.

## Me

- I am an artist and arts manager
- In a previous life I worked for software development companies
- Over the years I learned how to do a bit of computer programming
- But I am not a professional programmer!
- After too many years doing that I went back to art and arts manager school
- I studied performance art and tried not to do anything related to computers
- After I graduated I kept on trying to make performance art and
became a member of a collective that produced a biannual performance art festival
- In the last couple of years, I've returned to earlier interests in mark making
and multiples
- Instead of using pencil, paper, pen, and ink, I've been using a computer
- The computer language I've chosen to use for my work is called p5.js  

## You

- What kind of art are you making?
- How would you like to use computers to make art?
- Have you had any experience writing software programs?

# What we are going to do today

- look at some examples of generative art and drawing with code
- learn how to use the p5,js web editor to create sketches
- draw some sketches using p5's built-in shapes
- generate variations on sketches by introducing randomness
- animate the transitions between the sketches
- share our sketches using the p5.js web editor web site

# What we are not going to do today

- we aren't going to learn how to write complex computer programs
<br>
(but we are going to learn some basic programming concepts as we need them)
- we aren't going to do a lot of math (but we are going to do a little bit)
