# Varying the placement of shapes

We can vary the placement of shapes by using variables to represent their vertices
and assigning different values to the variables each time the sketch is drawn.

## Varying the placement of the circle

We can vary the placement of the circle by replacing the x and y coordinates with variables and assigning different values to the variables:

    var circleX = random(400);
    var circleY = random(400);
    ellipse(circleX,circleY);

## Varying the placement of the triangle
