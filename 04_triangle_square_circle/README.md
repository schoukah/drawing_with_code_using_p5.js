> In 1923 Wassily Kandinsky circulated a questionnaire at the Bauhaus,
asking respondents to fill in a triangle, square, and circle
with the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue...He hoped to discover a universal correspondence between form and color, embodied in the equation red=square, yellow=triangle, blue=circle.

In Kandinsky's experiment, participants were asked only to choose what colour to colour each shape. What are the choices we had to make while we were composing our sketches?
