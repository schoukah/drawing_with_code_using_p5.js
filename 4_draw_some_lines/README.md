# Draw some lines

p5.js has built-in functions to draw points and lines.

## Points

    point(x, y)

Draws a point, a coordinate in space at the dimension of one pixel.

## Lines

    line(x1, y1, x2, y2)

Draws a line (a direct path between two points).

## What are x and y?

x and y are the coordinate system used to identify a point on the canvas

- x is the horizontal distance from the top left corner  
- y is the vertical distance from the top left corner
