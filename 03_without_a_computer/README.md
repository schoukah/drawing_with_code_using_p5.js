# Drawing with Code without a Computer

Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!

Using a pencil or pen on a blank piece of paper:

    1. Draw a triangle anywhere on the page
    2. Somewhere in the remaining space, draw a circle
    3. Finally, in the remaining space, draw a square
    4. Colour in one of the shapes using one of the crayons
    5. Colour in a different shape using a different crayon
    6. Colour in the last shape using the last crayon

- Let's pin up our drawings.

- Let's reflect on the characteristics that are different in each drawing
  - placement
  - size
  - colour

## Triangle, Square, Circle: A Psychological Test

In 1923 Wassily Kandinsky circulated a questionnaire at the Bauhaus,
asking respondents to fill in a triangle, square, and circle
with the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue.

He hoped to discover a universal correspondence between form and color,
embodied in the equation red=square, yellow=triangle, blue=circle.
