# What can I do to keep working in p5.js?

Some options are:

- extend the sketch we've just made
- learn more about programming and p5.js
- contribute to an open project

## Extend the sketch we've just made

Try extending the sketch we just made:

- keep the shapes within the canvas
- add more colours to the colour array
- use rotation() to rotate the shapes as part of their transformation

## Learn more about programming and p5.js

There are a lot of tutorials on the p5.js website:

- https://p5js.org/learn/

These are two online courses that I found useful:

- *Creative Coding* on edX (https://www.edx.org/course/creative-coding)

- *Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with p5.js* on Kadenze (https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js-iii)

## Contribute to an open project

Solving Sol is an open project to implement Sol LeWitt's instructions in JavaScript:
